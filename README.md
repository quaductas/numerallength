# Length of numerals in the English language.

This is just some code for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6wrme8/number_of_letters_of_english_numerals_oc/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6y81jq/number_of_letters_of_german_numerals_oc/) post on Reddit. Data was created using Python and the visualisations were made with R. Find all the code in the root directory. In the csv-directory, you find all the csv-files (surprise).

**It may not always be recommendable to open .csv-files ending in "-1M.csv", because they contain one million (okay, itâ€™s actually 1,000,001) lines, so they are big.**
